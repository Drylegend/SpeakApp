h3,Khel Khoj,"REVA University is one of the few multidisciplinary Universities that uphold the culture and heritage through its various social outreach initiatives. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and NEP policy, the Department of Sports & Physical Education at REVA University has come up with a unique initiative called Khel Khoj, which is an attempt to bring to modern society the importance of traditional games and bring them back as a component of the Indian Knowledge System. With time, we have not only lost the zeal for indigenous games but also there are fewer playing spaces for children and students. In this modern era, it is always a challenge to find new ways to play traditional games in limited spaces. As pioneers in higher education and a Social Impact University, REVA, in alignment with UN SDGs, NEP 2020 and G20 India has initiated Khel Khoj to promote and revitalise indigenous sports. By doing this, REVA aligns with the Ministry of Education, Government of India and its mission to bring back traditional games from different Indian states. The name Khel Khoj means ‘Search for Games’. India has a rich culture and tradition and has always included sports and games with some ancient games dating back thousands of years. NEP 2020 talks in detail about how Universities must take the lead to bring innovative changes in our curriculum, by incorporating its suggestions and making a creative change in the education policy. This is where REVA University opened its door as pioneers in the country to conduct various events to uphold the culture and tradition. Khel Khoj is one of these many initiatives started by REVA. Khel Khoj event will kickstart at the REVA campus on February 11, 2023. The event will be held in Saugandhika, REVA University Sports ground and the open pathways inside the campus. As a part of this, REVA has identified more than 35 indigenous games that have their roots in various Indian states. In its initial phase of Khel Khoj, REVA focuses on field sports, martial arts, and indoor / board games, with intentions to expand on this with additional native games from different parts of the country. Each School will take up two indigenous sports and showcase them by exhibiting under various categories like the history of the sport, the values each game inculcate and showcasing the sport with various costumes, equipment and pictures. Additionally, there will be an activity where students and others can participate in games or experience a portion of the game Depending on the sports or games, there will also be team-building activities, research on the history of the games, coordination with associations of each sport, procurement of materials and eventually the execution of the games.

h3,Pañcavaktraṁ,"Pañcavaktraṁ is a production by the School of Performing Arts & Indic Studies of REVA University that highlights the five faces of Śiva – Sadāśiva and elaborates on them through significant stories from Indian mythology. As a part of the first phase of our campaign, we will be performing in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, New Delhi, Chennai, Guwahati, Bhubaneswar, Kolkata, and Varanasi. In Hyderabad( November 11th), Bengaluru ( November 16), New Delhi (November 26), Chennai (December 9), Guwahati (December 20), the event was held in front of a packed audience. The venue will house more than 2000 audience. There will be chief ministers, eminent gurus, and celebrities as guests for the programmes. The local art and artists will be felicitated in each City. There will be special seating arrangements for the press and media. The School of Performing Arts and Indic Studies will have a special stall that features various courses and other facilities available in the school. For more details about the programme, you can contact Datta Pasumarthi:+91970370831. There will be Chief Ministers, eminent gurus, and celebrities as guests for the programmes. The local art and artistes will be felicitated in each city. There will be special seating arrangements for the press and media. The SOPAIS will have a special stall in each venue that features information about various courses and other facilities available in the school. REVA is one of the few Multidisciplinary Universities that uphold the Indian culture and heritage through the SOPAIS. The Performing Arts, comprising music, dance, and theatre, are in demand as career choices, like never before. SOPAIS offers unique, challenging Performing Arts and Indic Studies programmes that prepare artistes for the future. These courses aim to bring a holistic view to the performing arts education system in India. NEP 2020 talks in detail about how art institutions must take the lead to bring innovative changes in our curriculum, by incorporating its suggestions and making a creative change in the education policy. This is where SOPAIS at REVA University opened its door as pioneers in the country to conduct various courses and events to uphold the culture and tradition. In alignment with the SDG goals and NEP policy, SOPAIS has taken up the initiative of bringing up this unique production called Pañcavaktraṁ which is a commitment towards society. It creates an awareness about the art and helps revive our age-old tradition and culture. Pancha means five and Vaktra means faces. The five faces are Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tatpuruṣa, and Eśāna and they are embodied through the five elements of nature or the Pañcabhūta - Bhūmi, Jala, Agni, Vāyu, and Akāśa. This production is of tremendous significance in the contemporary context. Our ancient treatises and texts chronicle a progressive and “woke” India that is gender-sensitive. The fact that the Lord Siva as Ardhanārīśvara encompasses the male and the female as two halves of the ultimate whole, the total of which is an all-embracing concept of gender and sexuality that existed long before these genders were separated brutally. The piece showcases the confluence of the five elements of Nature that are an integral part of the Indian spiritual identity. Our Vedic gods themselves were incarnations of different aspects of nature. The production showcases how the five elements superimpose each other with ease in their existence and movement creating harmony and balance in nature. Humans, unaware of the importance of ancient thought have time and again interfered with this balance. This production bridges the gap between the audience who live amidst the smog of global warming, extensive urbanization, and natural resource depletion, and the age-old tradition that has enlightening tales of sustainable development, harmonious living, and the importance of nature."

h3,Abhivyakti,"Under NEP, arts in education is a must and also promotes Indian languages, arts, and culture. REVA University is an interdisciplinary university that offers courses in Performing Arts. To empower teachers and overcome the challenges post-pandemic, the School of Performing Arts and Indic Studies has curated a unique certification course named ABHIVYAKTI for K 12 teachers. The objective of ABHIVYAKTI is to enhance the non-verbal communication of teachers in the post-pandemic era through facial expressions, gestures, and Natya techniques of Indian knowledge systems. The program includes arts, storytelling, the power of expression, dance and expressions, artificial intelligence in understanding the emotions of today’s students, and the importance of verbal communication in teaching-learning in the post-pandemic era. The certificate program will be delivered by an expert faculty team of the REVA School of Performing Arts along with an online session by an expert from an International University. The program will be organised for all CBSE/ICSE/State Board government and private schools as part of the Outreach program and Teacher Empowerment Strategy of REVA University. Day 1of Abhivyakti featured a lecture demonstration by Prof Manvita on the topic Bhāva which spoke of effective communication through facial expressions. We had teachers from various schools come for the event and engage wholeheartedly in the entire event as Prof. Manvita took them through a series of exercises and games on effective methods of communicating and from someone with such a body of experience in the field of education backed by her strong background in psychology and the performing arts, the advice shared was invaluable. Day 2of Abhivyakti featured a talk by noted dancer/academician, Dr. Viji Rao on the module of Angika. She highlighted the use of Angas (major limbs) and Pratyangas (ancillary limbs) in teaching. Her lesson for relevant and pertinent for all teachers but also included some key aspects of dance that can be utilised in teaching methods that help faculty maintain agility and energy while standing on their feet and delivering lectures. With her wealth of experience she was able to equip the attendees with useful tools for their work. Day 3of Abhivyakti was about Dhwani, voice modulation and projection with two interesting sessions. The first session was conducted by Prof. Kavana, Carnatic Music specialist who spoke about the different variations in voice that can be applied by teachers. She was able to address many questions by the participants on the importance of modulation in conveying the true intent of the lesson to the students. Prof. Akshar, a versatile theatrician, conducted an interactive session on the importance of Voice projection as a teacher in order to be able to have command over and the attention of the class. It was a lively and intriguing session for all participants. Day 4of Abhivyakti was conducted by Prof. Deepa Pillai and by Prof Anusha. The lecture was about storytelling. The speakers spoke about the tool of storytelling being very powerful and its impact on children. Storytelling is an essential part of teaching as the elements of Katha, when incorporated into teaching can transform dry subject matter to impactful and intriguing lessons. Day 5of Abhivyakti featured a talk by Mr. Hareesh, founder of Luminous, an illuminator of Science and Humanity, Preventia house, Bengaluru. His module was based on Varnana, or narrative elements which are particularly significant for teachers. He captivated the minds of all attendees with important pointers on narration that can be used in day-to-day teaching. Prof. Subhobroto from a neighbouring K12 school opined that there were a lot of important take-aways for him as a teacher in a school dealing with multiple age groups and he also spoke about how it would impact his teaching methodology going forward. Indian Knowledge System is extremely rich in providing various skill sets that one can learn and put into practice these skill to overcome the challenges and become good communicators. The School of performing Arts and Indic Studies is facilitating the process of adapting the skill sets that are clearly propounded in ancient Indian knowledge systems related to performing arts. The 5-day intensive training programme for teachers of K12 schools for non-verbal communication culminated on the 30th of September with a ceremony presided over by Honourable Chancellor, Dr P Shyamaraju. Teachers from different schools shared their experiences and feedback over the workshop and were presented with certificates by Honourable Chancellor sir and Director, School of Performing Arts & Indic Studies, Dr Vidya Kumari S who spearheaded this event."
h3,Pragna,"As socially responsible citizens and an institution committed to civic responsibility, we at REVA University, have started a movement‘Pragna’to raise awareness on road safety and road discipline. The neighbourhood is home to a number of schools and colleges apart from our University and hospitals. It is a common occurrence during rush hours for students to struggle to cross the street and arrive at school/ college on time. Women in particular are having trouble making it to their destination in a timely manner when they are walking on the footpath. Additionally, there are a number of hospitals in the area, making it challenging for emergency patients to get there on time owing to road indiscipline. As the stakeholders of REVA University, it is our responsibility to ensure that the safety on roads is kept up to par. It is in this juncture REVA has initiated ‘Pragna’ campaign in association with the traffic police, NSS, NCC, and the neighbouring educational institutions.

h3,Nyaya Darshana,"The term ‘Nyaya’ refers to Justice and ‘Darshana’ means vision. The School of Legal Studies, one of the prestigious law schools in the country at REVA University has come forward to bring in a social awareness campaign, especially among women, who are comparatively fewer in number in the domain of law. Nyaya Darshana is a series of events that contributes to the social development and betterment of society in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals IV, V, and XI. “Nyaya Darshana” is an initiative of the School of Legal Studies to imbibe moral and ethical values along with the study of law, and to ensure a sense of social responsibility in the students- aligning the goals of providing quality education and holistic development to the students with the Sustainable Development Goals. In Greece, the meaning of the word justice is “to each his due”. It means that every person gets what they deserve with moral, ethical, and legal considerations. In Roman society, the law was considered to be fair and just. The Representation of Lady Justice comes from a Roman society where she is the Goddess of Justice. In India, the representation of the Indian symbol of Justice is represented with a balance scale to show evidence must be weighed neutrally, while the representation of the blindfold shows impartiality to those in front of justice and the sword represents swiftness and finality of justice. Nyaya Darshana is aligned with SDG goals IV, V, and VII which signifies bringing awareness of justice to the rural and urban sectors, encouraging more women to participate in Nyaya Darshana, and collaborating and partnership with judges, political leaders, and advocates through legal aid centre of the School of Legal Studies respectively. The main objectives of Nyaya Darshana are: As part of the Nyaya Darshana, Probono clubs, lecture series, and panel meets are organised. This includes Pro Bono legal general services, lecture by learned judges and eminent advocates as well as legal aid to villages."

h3,Overview,
h3,Course Description,"Higher education across the globe is opening doors of its academic disciplines to real-world experiences. The disciplinary legitimacy is under critical review. Trans-border mobility and practice learning are being foregrounded as guiding principles. Interactive learning, bridging disciplines and facilitating learners to gain different competencies through judicious management of time are viewed as one of the greatest and most fascinating priorities and challenges today. The M.Sc. Mathematics is designed keeping in view the current situation and possible future developments, both at national and global levels. This course is designed to give greater emphasis to research. There is an ample number of courses providing knowledge in specialized areas of Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Real and Complex Analysis, Topology, Functional Analysis, Mathematical Statistics, Optimization, Computational Techniques, R-tools, and Python Program etc., facilitating students to choose specialised areas of their interest. Adequate attention is given to providing students with the basic concepts of analysis and modern computation techniques to be used and knowledge on the application of such concepts in the practical field. The project, being part of the curriculum, will certainly provide students with the experience of research and practical exposure to the working environment. The L: T: P structure of teaching and learning under Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) and Continuous Assessment Grading Pattern (CAGP) would certainly help our students learn and build competencies needed in this knowledge-based society. This handy document contains brief information about M.Sc. Mathematics, scheme of instruction, course content, CBCS-CAGP regulations and their advantages and calendar of events for the year will serve as a guiding path for students to move forward in the right direction. It would mould them with knowledge, skill, and ethical values to face the challenges of this competitive world with greater confidence in becoming proud citizens."

h5,#NAME?,
h6,Welcome to REVA University!,"In 2004, REVA Group of Institutions was established with the founding philosophy ‘Knowledge is Power’, and since then, we have been committed towards building a community of perpetual learners who can achieve what they aspire. From a small group of 150 students, REVA has grown into a massive community with more than 15,000 students studying at the University every year. As we nurture this community, we have realized learning should be continuous, and cross all borders. Hence, REVA University adopted the mission to make learning unlimited. Our driving principle ‘Learning Unlimited’ is empowered with the adoption of technology. As we have seen in the recent past, technology in education is not just an enabler, but a necessary medium, and the crisis in the Education sector during the pandemic helped us all understand the importance of virtual learning. Going forward, digital-first is an approach every University must adopt, and I am happy to share that much before in 2016 REVA University laid a roadmap to be a technology-driven university. Our early preparedness helped us in transition from offline to online learning. Now, Blended Learning is the way forward and is the biggest enabler of seamless learning. Our core vision remains to change the way students learn from traditional learning methodologies and we are happy to adapt and adopt technological changes. The ecosystem at REVA University is not only tech-centered but is developed in such a way that it contributes to the overall development of a student. Our exclusive executive programme RACE (REVA Academy for Corporate Excellence) has been ranked 2nd in India for MBA in Business Analytics, REVA NEST- the Start-Up Incubator, and many other academic initiatives are designed to make our students corporate-ready. In a step ahead, the UIIC (University-Industry Interaction Centre) programme allows students to interact, engage and learn from industry leaders. The UIIC is an exclusive programme of the University and a key facilitator in bridging the gap between the industry and the academia. In near future, we aim to make all the disciplines at par with our exclusive programmes, and REVA aspires to be a coveted multi-disciplinary institution in the global education sector. True leaders and game-changers are made when a University takes it on its shoulders to mould personalities and gives life to the ideas of its students. With the dedicated efforts of our eminent faculty members, I am certain REVA University students will be guided and mentored in such a way that they will be the leaders and game-changers of tomorrow."

h3,Manodhaara – REVA Centre for Well-Being,"Introduction Manodhaara-REVA Centre for Well-being is a student support service offered by REVA University in Bengaluru. Our mission is to help students to transform themselves to achieve their best physical and mental health through various services that cater to their needs. At Manodhaara, we understand that students face a variety of challenges that can impact their overall health and well-being, not just their academic and social growth. That's why we take a holistic approach to wellness, focusing on the mind, body, and spirit. Our goal is to help students achieve balance and harmony in their lives so that they can thrive academically and personally. Currently housed in G-03, Vivekananda Block, the centre is nestled among the engineering and non-engineering schools, easily accessible to the students, but secluded enough to offer them privacy. We are committed to provide a safe and supportive environment, where students feel safe and comfortable seeking help."
h3,Our Approach,"At Manodhaara, we believe that well-being is not only about physical health, but also about emotional and psychological health. That's why we offer counselling services to help students cope with stress, anxiety, and other challenges that can impact their mental well-being. We also understand that seeking help can be challenging, so the services come to you with an assurance that all information shared would be confidential and only by consent. Our goal is to help students develop healthy coping skills, improve relationships and grow to their fullest potential."
h3,Services,"Student Services include individual counselling and therapy for individuals, small groups, parents and teachers; talks and workshops are also conducted for large groups by the in-house counsellors. Preliminary assessment for disorders like anxiety, depression, Mood disorders, etc. are done and referred further to the psychiatrist where needed. The Centre is looking to expand its activities into research, training and outreach programmes not just for the REVA family but to the community at large, and in particular for the benefit of the students of the Government schools that have been adopted by REVA University. Our vision is to create a one-of-its-kind wellness centre that is a one-stop solution to all well-being concerns."
h3,"In the process, it is quite common to face some of the challenges such as:","Surprisingly, most youngsters go through more than one such challenge which results in an unpredictable lifestyle that may have a negative impact on their academic performance as well as behavioural pattern. They are reluctant to discuss their problems with their own parents, teachers/lecturers, friends and relatives as they get worried about the consequences."
h3,"Our University has provided counselling services within the campus. Counsellors offer talk-based therapy, which is a process of talking about and working through your personal problems with a counsellor.","The counsellor helps you to address your problems in a positive way by helping you to clarify the issues, explore options, develop strategies and increase self-awareness."
h3,"Counsellors are available at Swami Vivekananda Block, Room #G-03, Monday to Saturday between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm.",

h6,Welcome to REVA University!,Education today is a part of a larger movement world wide . For the first time in the generation after COVID we are in a position to review education differently. This is the time to bring about reforms in education both nationally and globally. One of the objectives of the NEP 2020 is to strengthen digital education and REVA has been consistent in this effort. One of our core commitments is also to make REVA a social impact University and in this path we shall strive to achieve some of the SDGs phase wise at the University. But that can only be done in the context of a reset of our entire university ecosystem. We need to think together in ensuring that our society is reshaped. Quality education which is foremost for us and women in education apart from reviving and restoring our rich heritage is a must have goal. The future of our education is digital and I have been emphasising and focusing on the same. At REVA we need to be quick in adapting to new advances in technology and offer students an array of chances to keep themselves abreast of the ever-changing world of technology. Technology I truly believe will bring learner’s across the world closer. Simply put Industry 4.0 will need Education 4.0 and at REVA I am confident that with the fast pace faculty team and stakeholders achieving this will be no great feat !

h2,Jagruti Towards Global Warming,
h2,Jagruti - The Journey So Far,
h2,What is Jagruti,"An awakening! A rise to action, a quiet revolution that could only be fostered amidst a growing intellectual community like REVA. In spite of an energetic cosmopolitan population, Bengaluru has been moving backward in terms of participation in the democratic machinery of the country. The overall aggregate voting enrollment and participation from urban India has been rather poor, as observed through the country. This disappointment strongly points towards the eminent failure and loss of faith amongst this populace in the ideals of democracy, so arduously built by the freedom struggle and the architects of our constitution. A large democracy naturally translates to a large voting population due to its sheer size. However, our country here needs a step up, not just in active involvement but also in being equipped with the right knowledge. This precipitation needs a boost. REVA Electoral Literacy Association (RELA) is a convinced endeavor by the University, faculty and students, to conscientiously evoke in citizens the awareness, knowledge of and need for ideally functioning democratic processes. The essence and vision of RELA is aligned with empowerment of the citizens for better participation in the electoral democracy in voluntarily registering and ethically voting in every election."
h2,Objectives of Jagruti,
h2,The Preparation,"REVA has been conducting interactive activities in the University campus to impart electoral education to students. The students have actively immersed themselves in a consolidated foregrounding required for this enterprising and enriching task. In order to inform and expose students to Indian General Elections, RELA had organized and ensured their participation in debates, essay writing competitions, Nirvachitra- a film show, celebration of National Voter’s Day, Democracy Wall and elucidation of the electoral history of the Country."

Sri Sreenivasachary, IAS (Retd.,), State Election Commission was the Guest of Honour of this event and Dr. P. Shyama Raju, Hon’ble Chancellor, REVA University presided over the event. This event witnessed the oath taking ritual for all at REVA to uphold independent India’s democratic values. The Guests and other dignitaries shared their thoughts on the growing need for democratic values to come into play for the betterment of our society. Student volunteers also exhibited a play which proclaimed the importance of voting."
h5,Important Activities,"REVA University recognizes the importance of growing fresh, healthy produce involving the students’ community. To cater to this need and contribute to the larger goal of sustainability, REVA University has organised a series of activities under the project. Chancellor Dr. P. Shyama Raju officially launched the Grow Bag planting and vertical modular agritecture on the campus. Grow Bag Cultivation On the launch day, around 300 grow bags were planted as part of REVA University’s commitment towards building a greener and sustainable world. Besides inspiring everyone to grow their fresh vegetables in grow bags, it also helps to learn about sustainable agriculture, share knowledge and enjoy the benefits of home-grown produce. The grow bag vegetable cultivation approach is designed to provide an ideal environment for plant growth, and it offers several benefits like space efficiency, water conservation, and portability. The grow bags of about 300 seedlings of potatoes, tomato, capsicum, chillies, and brinjal are planted by the students and will be individually allotted for their peer learning and nurturing. Vertical gardening or Vertical Agritecture Vertical gardening or Vertical Agritecture takes advantage of vertical spaces, transforming walls, fences, and even indoor areas into lush green gardens. The vertical modular agritecture is a wall-mounted structure in a soil-less medium and uses recycled resources. It is a blend of orientation (vertical) and agriculture with elements of architecture. This method offers several advantages like maximized space utilization, enhanced aesthetics, improved air quality, and biodiversity. It is a pilot model, with an eco-friendly vertical structure with an exotic vegetable demonstration unit. As part of the expansion, the team plans to organise a series of other activities in the future. Among them, Aeroponics, a soil-less plant-growing method is of top priority. The Aeroponics method involves suspending plants in an air or mist environment and offers various advantages like efficient water usage, accelerated plant growth and reduced pesticide use. Besides it promotes faster growth and efficient nutrient absorption. REVA University is also planning to promote Hydroponics, another soil-less farming technique which is an efficient, controlled environment for plant growth. It promotes sustainable agriculture in both urban and rural settings, contributing to food security and reduced environmental impact. It also helps to save water and allows year-round cultivation. REVA also plans to install roof gardens and photo voltaic gardens which are eco-friendly and energy-efficient methods of cultivation with the active participation of students."

h3,Direct Instruction,"In thismethod, teachers convey knowledge to their students primarily through lectures without considering student preferences or opportunities for hands-on or other types of learning."
h3,Flipped Classrooms,"Students are given the study material in advance and during classes, students will interact with the instructor to clarify their doubts about the material."
h3,Kinesthetic Learning,"In this method, students perform hands-on physical activities rather than listening to lectures or watching demonstrations. During practical, particularly in engineering and sciences, students work for lab practice."
h3,Inquiry-Based Learning,"In this method, teachers offer support and guidance as students work on projects that depend on them taking on a more active and participatory role in their own learning. This also provides project-based learning to the students."
h3,Personalized Learning,"Every faculty will provide some topics for self-learning during the subject delivery in the classrooms to have a better understanding of concepts. Also, teachers offer some traditional instructions as well as online material, while continually reviewing the students’ progress and meeting them to make any needed changes to their learning plans."

h3,"REVA University touched a new milestone by launching its very own Esports Club – REVARENA. Not to be confused with the mundane online gaming, Esports requires a unique set of skills and proficiency for competitive gameplay.","The vision encapsulated in the establishment of the REVARENA club is to encourage and discover the world of competitive gaming and its interplay with sports. The club will act as the bustling hub of gaming, networking with professionals and collaborating with developers to cherish the mutually shared passion for technology and esports. The club would additionally focus on developing and training young talent with the leading professionals in the industry."
h3,Objectives and Scope,"Esports, or competitive video gaming, has grown rapidly in popularity over the past few years, and many colleges and universities have started to recognize the benefits of having an esports club on campus. Such a club can provide opportunities for students to compete against other colleges, develop skills in teamwork, communication, and strategic thinking, and build a community around a shared interest. One of the main benefits of having an esports club on campus is that it can provide a sense of community and belonging for students who may not otherwise have a place to connect with others who share their interests. It can also help promote diversity and inclusion by providing a space where students of all backgrounds and skill levels can come together and learn from each other. Additionally, esports can help students develop valuable skills that are highly sought after by employers, such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. As esports continue to grow in popularity and become more mainstream, having experience in the field can be a valuable asset for students who are interested in pursuing careers in related fields such as game development, marketing, or event management. Overall, an esports club can be a valuable addition to any college or university, providing opportunities for students to compete, build community, and develop valuable skills."
h3,Core Committee,"A formal Core Committee team has been formed by the students, where over 15 students with specific roles & responsibilities have been established. These roles range from league operators, tournament managers, discord moderators, tournament admins, mobile admins, etc. Committee members team will be reporting to the Director of Physical Education and Sports with day-to-day updates and will be the custodians of managing the club. The club has also identified Student Ambassadors who will represent the University’s interest in the gaming industry. They will closely work with organizations who can support the University in various activities and in bridging the two parties."
h3,College / University Ambassadors,"A university ambassador is a student representative who works on behalf of the university to promote and enhance the institution's image and reputation. Ambassadors are typically chosen based on their academic performance, leadership skills, and involvement in campus activities. University ambassadors can develop skills in communication, leadership, and event planning that can be valuable in their future careers. Currently we have Student Ambassadors for the following esports organizations."

The event held at REVA Rangasthala, Vivekananda Block commenced at 8.00 AM and continued until 9.00 AM. The inauguration ceremony was presided over by Dr N Ramesh Registrar. The celebration was marked by the gracious presence of Mr Ashoka V, Founder & Director Pranava Yoga Prathistana (R), Bengaluru; Dr R C Biradar Pro Vice Chancellor REVA University; along with Dr Beena G, Controller of Examination; Ashwinkumar U Motagi Professor at REVA University.

Dr. N Ramesh Registrar of REVA University addressed the gathering by explaining the significance and advantages of yoga. He said, “Regular practising of yoga helps to improve the body flexibility as well as mental health. Yoga is an effective form of exercise like swimming. Both ensure overall body movements and flexibility, yet, yoga consists of both body movements and pranayama. Hence, yoga not only improves your health but also your immune system. ”. The yoga session began with the demonstration of yogasanas by one of the students of REVA University. The Guest of Honour, Mr Ashoka V, Founder & Director Pranava Yoga Prathistana (R), Bengaluru, conducted a lengthy yoga session by demonstrating various yoga poses and exercises. During the demonstration, he also briefed about the essence of each yogic asana and breathing techniques. Students alongside REVA staff participated in the yoga session by following the Guruji. It was indeed an enjoyable and relaxing yoga session from the Guest of Honour. The session concluded with a prayer and the guest thanked everyone who was instrumental in conducting the International Day of Yoga at REVA University including Honourable Chancellor, Dr. P. Shyama Raju and other respected dignitaries. He also urged students and Faculty to continue practising yoga for their overall well-being."

h2,About Me,"The love of technology has always encouraged me to learn new things. I have experience in some of the deep learning applications, such as data classification, detection and generation. I have knowledge with almost all the concepts I have taught. The idea of computer is learning from the data given to it by itself is mind blowing and that is one of the reasons why I chose computer science as my field of engineering. Besides technology, I 'm playing PC and Mobile games, and I'm doing a little bit of photography."

Graduate in Computer Science and Engineering and Teaching Assistant at RACE ( Reva Academy of Corporate Excellence) for Business Analytics, have always been fascinated towards technology ever since my school days, with an immense interest in technology I always wanted to learn it and apply for solving real life problems. While searching and reading technical blogs, I discovered Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and it is coined as one of the sexiest jobs in 21st century. It amazed me and I have been dedicating my education to that ever since. I have done several courses online, been reading a host of articles, even enrolled in two related courses this year in Coursera and Data Camp."

h3,G20 India Introduction,"REVA University has also been the pioneer in adopting and supporting the various initiatives of the Government and has built a road map for the G20 Presidency of India. With the G20 focus to be on bringing unity to tackle larger global challenges such as economic downgrade, indebtedness of countries and the climate crisis amid persisting divisions that are happening at present, we at REVA are sensitive to the initiatives and plans taken up by the Government in this regard. A key element that will be highlighted in the G20 is towards the climate crisis and REVA has been conducting various initiatives like Vanamahotsava and the like which includes celebrating the year ahead as the ‘Year of the Millets’ in the state of Karnataka using the youth power. Coincidentally, the G-20 India theme Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam – One Earth, One Family, One Future, aligns with our own dance production Panchavaktram, which highlights the panch tattva of earth, air, water, fire and space to convey how our tradition sees all living beings as composed of the same 5 elements. G 20 Presidency also highlights the importance of environmentally sustainable and responsible choices, both at the individual level and national level. At REVA, we ensure we align with this in various ways, thereby contributing to globally transformative actions resulting in a cleaner, greener, and bluer future. REVA University is responding to G 20 Presidency by promoting links between universities and the environment in a sustainable, holistic, responsible and inclusive manner. By aligning with G 20 presidency REVA ensures towards a prosperous, futuristic, inclusive and developed society which is distinguished by a human-centric approach at its core. We are making all efforts of living in harmony with the surrounding ecosystem in a sustainable manner."

Since 2017, Gopinath is conducting studies on the realistic exposure and internalization of plastic particles into human system and assessed the hazardous health effects in humans. His remarkable findings include, oxidative stress mediated senescence and autophagic effects in keratinocytes, ER stress mediated cell-specific accumulation of lipid droplets in macrophages and foam cell formation, and genotoxic effect in blood cells. Currently, he is working across discipline to develop techniques for detection and quantification of MNPs in blood, food and environmental matrixes explore."

h3,Research Project,"My PhD research program includes paradigms of the development of informative dbEST-SSR markers for sugarcane and their applications in various genetic studies like; genetic purity testing, genetic diversity, cross-transferability, linkage mapping, genotype identification and fidelity testing of tissue culture raised plants. I have primary research interest in developing genomic resources for crops and their utilization in different aspects i.e., genetic purity, genetic diversity & population structure, plant health, and trait improvement using advance linkage/association mapping and genomic selection approaches. I have been worked in the area of crop research with a broad range of approaches used in genetic improvement of the crops in terms of yield, nutrient & quality and stress resistance traits. I have published articles, review papers in pearly-reviewed journals and abstracts in proceedings of the conferences/symposiums during post-doctoral, doctoral and pre-doctoral research projects covering a broad range of scholarly interests."

TGR5 receptor activation on smooth muscle reveals a novel mechanism for the regulation of gut motility by bile acids. The progression of alcoholic liver disease is characterized by steatosis, inflammation, necrosis and finally fibrosis and cirrhosis. When severe hepatitis occurs, death is outcome. Our study was aim to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of glycine, a non-essential amino acid in alcohol-induction. International Visits"

h4,Ideate. Innovate.,"It facilitates multidisciplinary research to deal with the complexities of human settlements as a whole. The School has developed a network of top architects and designers and have involved them in teaching and guiding, It has a vision to train learners who should be sensitive towards pain, plight, pleasure, happiness, comfort, leisure, aspirations, expectations of people and responsive towards nature, environment, society and nation, coupled with ethics and human values. The School of Architecture, REVA University has been listed amongst ""Karnataka’s Top 20 Institutions"" by Academic Insight Magazines."
h4,Vision,“To make the School known for highest level academic standards in inculcating necessary skills and national pride in students to address societal issues through technology”.
h4,Our Mission,
h4,Vidya Srikanth,"Director I/C,"
h4,School of Architecture Director's Message,"A student doesn’t choose architecture…. rather architecture chooses you. Every student who walks into the portals of the school is here because he or she is special. They inherently have a streak of creativity, a sense of style, or the ability to imagine and visualise that which hasn’t still been built. This is the quality that gives them a cut above the rest to make a difference to the world outside. We at the school are committed to nurture this in every student through creative studio exercises, community engagement, hands-on workshops, site visits for technical courses, and study tours that connect one to the rich architectural heritage of India or the World. We also encourage exposure to software tools that aid drafting, rendering and simulations to ensure that the overall programme outcomes are met and every student gains a 360-degree learning. Having a role model or mentor is very crucial to a young mind and our dedicated team of faculty members ensure this by guiding them towards research, project-based learning, collaborative studios, internships, options for professional electives and specializations that give our graduates the extra advantage. Our institutional collaboration with the Indian Institute of Architects (I IA) and Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) provide a platform for students to engage with the profession, participate in competitions and win awards. Our International collaborations for student exchanges, workshops, immersive study tours and faculty presentations for conferences ensure that students never fall short of opportunities. We have collaborations across Europe, UK and USA with Universities that offer Summer and Winter schools that give a flavour of International education to the undergraduate students, preparing them for higher studies in different cultures should they choose to. We do offer a Doctoral research programme with scholars researching on diverse topics of interest in architecture and planning. We are now looking to broaden our horizon by adding programme offerings in the post graduate level, with an M.Arch. in Environmental Architecture and M.Plan. with a specialization in Smart City Planning. Both courses are contemporary, much sought after and are the need of the hour. The programmes are aimed at working professionals who are passionate about sustainable design solutions both at city and building level that offer energy saving and smart solutions. Surely, these new programmes will carve out a unique niche for REVA University School of Architecture to pave the way to be leaders in architecture education in India I believe that our students will undoubtedly choose their future career path with confidence; be it academics, entrepreneurship, self-employment or working for a large consortium. A REVA alumnus will be a lifelong learner, a leader and an asset to any organization. Come, discover our world and prepare yourself to be transformed."

Here, students not only develop knowledge in their area of specialization but also acquire practical skills useful for their future careers. We take great pride in our students who have been performing exceedingly well in the field of academics and co-curricular activities and have been bringing laurels to the University every year.

The primary research involves Cultural Studies in Literature with special reference to the folktales/Origin Stories/Creation myths of the five major tribes of Jharkhand. Abridging the creation myths of these five tribes into an entity and exploring the inner sense of the myths is an addition to the gathered knowledge of folk literature.

h4,School of Civil Engineering - Director's Message,"The Civil Engineering Curriculum is designed to keep in view the current situation and possible future developments, both at national and global levels. This course is designed to give greater emphasis on core Civil Engineering. There are ample number of courses providing knowledge in specialized areas of Structural Engineering, Water Resources Engineering, Transportation Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Surveying and Environmental Engineering etc. facilitating students to choose specialized areas of their interest. The B.Tech programme aims to prepare human resources to play a leading role in the competitive construction field and excel in their endeavors. The Master’s degree programmes focus on research and design in the core programmes like Computer Aided Structural Engineering, Transportation Engineering & Construction Technology and Management to supplement and creates sustainable world and to enhance the global quality of life by adopting enhanced techniques of design and application. This is reflected in various core subjects offered within the programme. Currently Civil Engineering teaching is limited to planning, analysis, design, and execution of different types of infrastructure like buildings, roads, bridges, dams, and power plants. However, due to the increase of technological sophistication and demand for higher living standards geared up by economic growth and concerns about environmental impact have changed the scope of Civil Engineering. The structure of the course has undergone a face-lift with the introduction of subjects from latest advanced subjects like Town Planning, Urban Transport Planning, Prestressed & Precast Structures, Solid Waste Management, Industrial Wastewater Treatment etc. Thus, the Civil Engineering stream is designed to provide you with several options to choose from for your later years. REVA University would like to offer Civil Engineering Programme to produce quality engineers who are effective and efficient in problem solving and providing economical and sustainable infrastructural solutions. I am sure the students choosing B Tech in Civil Engineering in REVA University will enjoy the curriculum, teaching and learning environment, the vast infrastructure and the experienced teacher’s involvement and guidance. We will strive to provide all needed comfort and congenial environment for their studies. I wish all students pleasant stay in REVA and grand success in their career I am sure the students choosing B.Tech. in Civil Engineering in REVA University will enjoy the curriculum, teaching and learning environment, the vast infrastructure and the involvement and guidance from experienced teachers.

h4,Center of Excellence,
h4,Vision,"The School of Electronics and Communication Engineering is envisioned to be a leading centre of higher learning with academic excellence in the field of electronics and communication engineering blended by research and innovation in tune with changing technological and cultural challenges supported with leadership qualities, ethical and moral values."
h4,Our Mission,
h4,Dr. K.M Sudharshan,"Professor and Director, School of ECE"
h4,School of Electronics and Communication Engineering Director's Message,"Since the inception of REVA University, School of Electronics and Communication Engineering is involved in implementing following best practices in various dimensions such as academics, research, outreach activities, student development programs, project based and research based learning, student centric learning, student competitions, industry and in-house internships, abroad internships, skill enhancement activities, motivation for competitive exams, course based projects, research based projects, mini projects, major projects and industry mentored projects, multidisciplinary projects, industry visits, technical talks by industry and academicians, certification programs, etc. Individual students are taken care by strong mentoring system wherein faculty members are not only allotted as mentors to students, but also, they will act as local guardians and they will have constant follow up with mentees in regard to academic and personal issues till students complete the degree. The curriculum is carefully designed to meet the current industry trends and also to provide insight into future technology developments that lead to inculcate lifelong learning abilities in students. Board of Studies (BoS) comprises people from academics, industry, alumni and current students which form the strong backbone for our programs wherein constant updates happen in contents/subjects every semester based on current industry needs. Curriculum has good mix of foundation courses, hardcore courses, softcore courses, practical and projects along with open electives on par with global education standards. Student’s welfare is given utmost priority at School of Electronics and Communication Engineering. Advanced learning methods are adopted to make learning truly interactive. More focus is on discussion and practical applications rather than rote learning. Notes/handouts/video contents/quizzes are given and critical thinking questions are asked to test understanding. Experienced, well qualified and friendly faculty members always strive hard to provide best of education to students. The faculty members have number of publications in reputed national and international journals/conferences. The school is also involved in funded research projects. I am sure the students choosing B Tech and M. Tech programs in School of Electronics and Communication Engineering in REVA University will enjoy the curriculum, teaching and learning environment, well equipped laboratories, digital classrooms infrastructure and the experienced teachers involvement and guidance."

Since it was a place of worship at its core we had to follow some of the customs and rules of the temple like we had to remove our shoes and maintain a certain level of decorum and respect towards the place. after we removed our shoes we were escorted towards the conference room built in the temple. After which we met up with Mr. Praveen (program coordinator) with whom we discussed the mission, vision, impacts, and strategies of Akshaya Patra and its success."
